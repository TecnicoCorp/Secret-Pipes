## This directory exists to store all of your secrets

#### NO JAVASCRIPT SHOULD EVER BE COMMITED TO THIS DIRECTORY! EVER! <br /> We've all done it, but DON'T DO IT.

All you have to do to incldue secrets in the export is create a new `.js` file using default exports.
e.g.
```js
exports.default = {
    mySecret:'some secret text'
}
```

For more examples and explanations see the other READMEs and example files.

This file mainly exists to keep this directory open for clarity.
